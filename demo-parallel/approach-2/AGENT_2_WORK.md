# Agent 2 - Security Hardening Approach

## Mission: Strengthen system security and vulnerability protection

### Analysis Started: 2025-01-18
### Focus Areas:
- Input validation implementation
- Authentication system upgrade
- Encryption at rest and in transit
- Security configuration hardening
- Penetration testing

### Key Findings:
1. **Input Validation**: Missing sanitization on user inputs
2. **Authentication**: Using deprecated JWT implementation
3. **Encryption**: Database passwords stored in plain text
4. **HTTPS**: Mixed content issues on several pages
5. **Headers**: Missing security headers (CSP, HSTS)

### Security Strategy:
1. Implement comprehensive input validation
2. Upgrade to secure JWT with refresh tokens
3. Add database encryption and secret management
4. Configure HTTPS enforcement and security headers
5. Set up automated security scanning

### Security Metrics:
- Current vulnerability score: 7.2/10 (HIGH RISK)
- Target vulnerability score: <3.0/10 (LOW RISK)
- Current security headers: 2/8 implemented
- Target security headers: 8/8 implemented

### Implementation Progress:
- [x] Security audit completed
- [x] Vulnerability assessment finished
- [ ] Input validation implementation in progress
- [ ] Authentication upgrade pending
- [ ] Encryption implementation pending

### Agent 2 Status: ACTIVELY WORKING ON INPUT VALIDATION
